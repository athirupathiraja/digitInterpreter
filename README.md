# Digit Interpreter

## Introduction
Three layered Neural Network to interpret the numerical value of digits from its visual representations. 

## Neural Network Architecture
**Dataset:** Built using the MNIST handwritten digit database, consisting of **_'m'_ training images**, with each image spanning 28 x 28 pixels. 

**Input Layer (_L_=[0]):** Input Layer has 784 nodes, each representing one pixel in the image of 28 by 28 pixels. 

**Output Layer (_L_=[2]):** Output Layer has 10 nodes, each representing a possible numerical prediction ranging from 0 to 9.
